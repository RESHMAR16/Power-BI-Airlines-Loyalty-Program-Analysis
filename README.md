# Power-BI-Airlines-Loyalty-Program-Analysis
This dataset is about **Northern Lights Air (NLA),** a fictional Canadian airline, and its **Customer Loyalty Program.** To boost memberships, NLA conducted a promotional campaign from **February to April 2018** as part of its enrolment drive.

# DATA BACKGROUND

This dataset is about Loyalty program of Canadian Airlines called Northern Lights Air(NLA). The Airlines aims to take enrollments for loyalty membership program and did a promotion campaign from February  to April 2018.
It has two tables viz Customer Flight Activity, where it gives the Flight Booking History for six years from 2012 to 2018 and the other table called Customer Loyalty History with 16,738 Loyalty members. It also contains their membership details like enrollment, cancellation(if any), membership type and their demographic details.

Apart from the regular descriptive variables, I find CLV interesting and want to analyze the Customer Churn.
After doing different basic charts I figured “Grouping by” the loyalty numbers from  the Customer Flight Activity table, will make it easier to merge 3 lakh plus rows, with the Customer Loyalty History table.
This opens up a lot of possible important key metrics analysis easier.
